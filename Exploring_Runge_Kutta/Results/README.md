The results obtained (briefly) 
1. The method converges as O(1/(n^2)), where n is the number of the grid nodes
2. Out of parameters 0.5, 0.75 and 1 the 0.75 parameter seems to be producing the best results in terms of precision  
3. In the second picture is the graph of the solution when N equals to 1000  
4. In the third picture is the graph of the solution for different N's: Yellow for N=20, Red for N=80, Blue for N=200.
