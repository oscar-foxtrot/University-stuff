# Numerical methods  
This is a solution for a simple task from the field of numerical methods. 

The task is to find the solution for the following Cauchy problem:

Using the Runge-Kutta numerical method of the second order.  
Study the convergence of the method on regular grids within [0, 1] segment, starting at N = 20 (where N is the number of segments)  
Try different parameters of the method to find out which one is better (or do they all give the same precision?)
