# Numerical methods  
This is a solution for a simple task from the field of numerical methods. 

The task is to find the solution for the following Cauchy problem:

Using the Runge-Kutta numerical method of the second order.  
Study the convergence of the method,  
Try different parameters of the method to find out which one is better (or do they all give the same precision?)
