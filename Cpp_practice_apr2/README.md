# Task
Define the "queue" and "stack" classes as derived from some abstract base class "storage". Define the open methods "add", "extract", and "print" in all these classes. Information stored in the queue and stack should be placed in dynamic memory. In the main function, create a local array variable of pointers to storage objects, fill it with pointers to queue and stack objects allocated in dynamic memory, fill the queues and stacks with some information, and then output their contents to the screen.
