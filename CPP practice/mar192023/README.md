2. Write a program in which classes "Shelf", "Book", "Journal" are defined.  
Organize the storage of information in those classes in such a way that a shelf would be able to contain up to 100 books and journals.  
A "book" is characterized by its name and the number of pages in it.  
A "journal" is characterized by its name and two lists - article titles and the number of pages in them.  
All of the data attributes should be private.  
Use std::string to store the titles.  
Put in main a piece of code such as that it creates one instance of "shelf". The data must contain at least 2 journals.  
a) Print all of the articles' titles  
b) Print all of the artiles' titles the number of pages in which is not less than a certain value.  
c) Print all of the artiles' titles that begin with a certain substring and end with a certain character (char)    
  
3. Complete the program from the previous task so that it can do the following:  
Check whether there are journals in a shelf such that they contain articles with the same names. Print the titles of such journals.
